# stAR.

StAR is an Android app that leverages Augmented Reality to let users explore and experience space related content from their phones. Using the device's geolocation, the app requests APIs to show the moon phases, star chart and astronomy image of the day, along with fun facts about space. The star chart model was created using Three JS to be dispalyed via AR. Other amazing 3D models that the user can explore via AR include the Earth, the Moon, Mars, Venus, Jupiter, Hubble Space Telescope and the Curiosity Rover.
